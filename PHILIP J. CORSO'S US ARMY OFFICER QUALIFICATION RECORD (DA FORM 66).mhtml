    <p><u>The Day After Roswell</u>, caused immediate controversy when it w=
as published in
    1997 because of the apparent qualifications and background of the autho=
r retired US Army
    officer Philip J. Corso, and because of the extraordinary claims made i=
n the book: that
    Corso handled and parceled out to US industry technology recovered from=
 a UFO crash in New
    Mexico in the late 1940's. </p>
    <p>The documents, images of which are presented below, were originally =
obtained by Larry
    Bryant through a Freedom of Information Act request, subsequently suppl=
ied to <a href=3D"mailto:jan@cyberzone.net">Jan Aldrich</a> of <a href=3D"h=
ttp://www.project1947.com/" target=3D"_top">Project
    1947</a>, and finally sent to us by Jan. The documents are Philip J. Co=
rso's Department of
    the Army Form 66, Officer Qualification Record, which summarizes his mi=
litary career. The
    information contained in this record is in summary form, and generally =
can't be used to
    determine specific reasons why something happened in a person's career.=
 Some items are
    blacked out because of the Privacy Act. Some items are in apparent conf=
lict with
    statements made in <u>The Day After Roswell</u>.</p>
    <p>CUFON is presenting these items in furtherance of our goal to make p=
ertinent
    information freely available to an interested public. Corso's book has =
further divided
    much of the UFO community seemingly validating the belief systems of so=
me, and damaging
    those of others. Corso's credibility results largely from the credentia=
ls he brought to
    the subject by virtue of his military career. The documents presented h=
ere, while not his
    whole military personnel record, shows some apparent conflicts with cla=
ims made in The Day
    After Roswell.</p>
    <p>Comments below are from Jan Aldrich: </p>
    <p>The information on the forms provides the following facts: </p>

/p>
    <p>DA Form 66's are generally better maintained for officers than for e=
nlisted personnel.
    Assignments and "duties performed" for officers are usually taken from =
their
    rating reports. However, mistakes are incorporated into the form more f=
requently than
    personnel officers would like. The officer is required to audit his for=
m periodically and
    Corso's form indicates that an audit was done just prior to his retirem=
