## The Evolution

In The Beginning, the Flying Saucer phenomenon became a
reality with reported sightings by credible witnesses in th summer of 1947. 
The reports by Kenneth Arnold on June 24th and United Airlines pilots on July 4th were the focus of media
attention and created a shroud around the events in and around
Roswe ll, New Mexico beginning on July 2nd. The sightings there
and reports of a crash nearby set the stage for the evolution of a cover-up .
