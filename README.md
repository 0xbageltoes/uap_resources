# Key OSINT UAP Resources
Some of the key UAP related reading/listening materials are from Corso, Crain, Elizondo, Davis, Puthoff, Hastings,  a few 1940's-1950's-era memo leaks, the declassified Austrialian report, and some other things. I believe this material, taken as a whole, tells a reasonably coherent picture of UAP C/R's ("crash recoveries" - Puthoff/Davis/Corso/Crain) since the early 40's and an active R&D program that seeded US industry with "exotic materials" (Corso, Crain, Elizondo).
