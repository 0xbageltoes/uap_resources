Kewper's interview with LMH - thanks to Stephen @StephenApWales.

His real name appears to be "Oscar Wayne Wolff", 17 SEP 1935 Park Rapids, MN, to 18 MAR 2015 Menahga, MN. Or was this his CIA given name? We're trying to figure it out.

Key dates:
Audio interview: June 6, 1998: On Coast to Coast with LMH
Video interview recorded: March 5, 2013
Video interview released: April 4, 2014 (actually still alive!)
Wolff's/Kewper's Death: March 18, 2015

(Thanks to @mrjeffknox for help with this candidate.)
