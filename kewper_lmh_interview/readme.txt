Kewper's interview with LMH
Thanks to Stephen @StephenApWales

His real name appears to be "Oscar Wayne Wolff", 17 SEP 1935 Park Rapids, MN, to 18 MAR 2015 Menahga, MN. Or was this his CIA given name? We're trying to figure it out.

Key dates:
Audio interview: June 6, 1998: On Coast to Coast with LMH
Video taken on March 5, 2013: He was alive
Video released April 4, 2014: Actually still alive
Wolff's Obituary: March 18, 2015

(Thanks to @mrjeffknox for help with this candidate.)
